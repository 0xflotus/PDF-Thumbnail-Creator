### NPM package for creating thumbnails for uploaded files(PDFs).

 **As you might have observed, when a file is uploaded to Google Drive, it is shown in the form of a thumbnail. So in this project we will at first create the thumbnail for any uploaded pdf and then convert that node server to a NPM package.**

### Prerequisites :
1. Basic Knowledge of JS.
2. Knowledge of Node server.
3. Document access in JS/Node 


#### *No need to take tension about converting a node server to a NPM package it is easier than you think.*
